# Data-Mining-and-Large-Scale-Visualisation
 As part of my MSc in AI, I was tasked with answering a health-related question using data mining and visualisation techniques.
 
Through scraping data and utilising datasets found on the web, Cardiovascular disease and the factors which affect it on a global scale was approached.

The end result is a dashboard which combines techniques such as choropleths, heatmaps and a simple expert system in one iPython output.
